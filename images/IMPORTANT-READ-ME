TO ADD IMAGES TO THE GALLERY:
-- add them to a folder inside "gallery/"
-- run "./make-gallery" (it's a really short bash script)

TO UPDATE HOW THE GALLERY IS GENERATED:
-- edit the source code in the MakeGallery directory
-- create a runnable JAR file for the program at "MakeGallery/MakeGallery.jar"
-- run "./make-gallery" to generate "gallery.html"
