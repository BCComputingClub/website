<h1>What A Student Owes His Teacher<span style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rev. James V. Schall, S.J.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students do not go to school to learn what teachers happen
to think. They go</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that they might, along with their professors, hear together
the &quot;inner truth&quot; of things, a grace that engages all alike in one
enterprise that takes them to the heart of reality, that to which our
intellects ought to conform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me begin with the following passage from Augustine's
treatise &quot;On the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>For do teachers profess that
it is their thoughts which are perceived and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>grasped by the students, and
not the sciences themselves which they convey<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>through thinking? For who is
so stupidly curious as to send his son to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>school that he may learn
what the teacher thinks?...Those who are pupils<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>consider within themselves
whether what has been explained has been said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span

that interior truth, according to the measure of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>which each of us is able.
Thus they learn, and when the interior truth makes<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>known to them that true
things have been said, they applaud... [1]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice the seriousness with which Augustine stated the fact
that students</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must consider &quot;within themselves&quot; whether what has
been said has been said</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;truly&quot;. The truth does not leave us indifferent,
and when it does, it is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not the truth that is at fault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students have obligations to teachers. I know this sounds
like strange</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doctrine, but let it stand. No doubt someone will object
that teachers also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have an even greater obligation to students. Teachers who do
not consider</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this same &quot;interior truth&quot; of which Augustine
spoke, woe to them. But the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>former doctrine, if less popular, especially among students,
is probably</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>still more important. For students are in some sense
spiritual beings and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have, therefore, precisely &quot;obligations&quot;. The
order of soul ought to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>correspond to the order of reality, the reality in which
soul itself came to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For his part, the teacher probably knows his basic
obligation, even if he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does not practice it. The student may not yet know. The
teacher-student</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship is, in fact, primarily a spiritual
relationship-both, teacher</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and student, participate in what is not properly theirs.
Something can be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>known in the spiritual order without becoming less. This is
what teaching</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and learning are about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some writers, indeed, like Mortimer Adler, will say that
there are no</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>teachers, only different degrees of learners. [2] There is
considerable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truth here, if the statement is understood properly, I do
not think I have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ever assigned anything to students that I did not want to
learn myself-even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if I already knew it. Something worth learning is worth
learning again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, most things you cannot learn at all if you do not
attempt to learn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them again. A teacher is someone distinguished only by the
fact that he has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more time than most to learn again, someone who has
hopefully tried to learn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>again more often. Society desperately needs enclaves like
monasteries and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>universities wherein men and women have such leisure. But we
should never</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forget that the primary place of leisure and of the
knowledge of the higher</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>order of things begins and ends almost always in our homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a modern university, where the student or his good
parents have to pay a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heavy, nondeductible penny to keep him in class, the issue
of a student's</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>responsibility to the teacher may be also an economic one,
even a mutual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>contractual obligation of the kind that lawyers are trying
to define in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>courts in order to attach tenure and the vagaries of
rambling professors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such legal efforts to make the student-teacher relationship
contractual and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>legal are probably already signs of civilizational decay.
The attempt to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bring &quot;justice&quot; into the classroom is at best a
failure to understand things</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>beyond politics-the most important things, really.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a university, students and teachers are formally related
to each other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because each is related to something else outside of each.
The essential</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;activity&quot; of teaching and learning is mostly
independent of the personal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship of student and teacher, if there even be such.
Too much is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>made, I think, of the idea of the small, intimate atmosphere
of a classroom,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where everyone can really &quot;get to know each
other&quot;. Much of my most</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>important learning took place in huge classrooms. I remember
especially</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Professor Rudolf Allers at Georgetown during my graduate school
days. He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>never actually looked at the class, but his wisdom did. [3]
I do not want to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>deny that sometimes-rarely, probably, especially in the
Aristotelian</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sense-students and teachers become friends. But at
universities, students</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are usually too busy becoming friends with each other-and
changing friends,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as Aristotle also said-ever to worry much about crotchety
old Professor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jones, or Schall, as the case may be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I have had too many students in class over the years, in
San Francisco,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in Rome, and now in Washington, D.C., to think that normally
a professor is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>going to know many students in more than a formal fashion
during a brief</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>semester or two in Government 117 or whatever the course may
be. Knowing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>students too well can in fact be something of an impediment
to learning,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>especially for the other students in the class-acceptio
personarum, as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aquinas called it. The activity of learning goes on, perhaps
even better,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when student and teacher are addressing themselves to the
matter at hand, to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the reason why they are in the same place, at the same time,
with a kind of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mutual awe before something they neither created nor made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here, it is the functioning of the student I am
concerned about. From my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience, I would say that the students I have had have
been good</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>students; so I do not write about the problems of lack of
intelligence, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what to do with superior intelligence. Furthermore, I am one
of those who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>think we learn in order to learn the truth, so that the
prestige of a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>university is not necessarily a good criterion of education
itself. I know a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lot of famous places where one can learn a lot of things
that are not true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, one can be a good student and still not be very
bright, just as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>someone can be very bright in native ability but quite a
poor specimen of a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>student. Some wag once said that college education is when
the notes of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>professor pass into the notebooks of the students without
passing through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the minds of either. The purest learning probably takes
place in direct</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speech with those who know or when we are alone, when, as my
classes recall</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with Cicero, we are never less alone. [4] With our memories,
with our books,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we can also be taught by teachers like Plato and St.
Augustine, who are not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>actually living in our time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most universities, like the one at which I teach, have a
system by which</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>students grade their teachers, an evaluation that can be
helpful or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vindictive or worthless, depending on how it is designed,
filled out, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>used. So students have some obligation to judge teachers
both fairly and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>frankly. But likewise the teacher must judge the students
not merely against</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each other, but against the standard of the discipline,
against the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>performance of the best. The teacher always stands, as it
were, for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>higher law of the best before the student, even though
teaching is also the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>effort to pass on what can be learned, even if it be a
minimum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This inner tension we feel within ourselves, too, is why
Aristotle had said</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of God that even if we cannot learn much about Him, still we
ought to spend</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as much time as we can learning what we can. Indeed, since I
will often</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>refer to these powerful lines of Aristotle, let me cite
them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we ought not to listen to those who counsel us &quot;O
man, think as man</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should&quot; and &quot;O mortal, remember your
mortality.&quot; Rather ought we, so far as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in us lies, to put on immortality and to leave nothing
unattempted in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>effort to live in conformity with the highest thing within
us. Small in bulk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it may be, yet in power and preciousness it transcends all
the rest</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1177b31-78a2). [5]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Classrooms, then, are in a sense like golf courses, where
the standard of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>par looms over our performances, good or bad, no matter by
how much we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>beaten the others in the foursome with whom we are actually
playing. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>highest things require our attentive efforts no matter how
satisfied we be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with what is less than the highest. The imperfect is not the
perfect and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ought not to be confused with it. None the less, the highest
things do call</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us out of ourselves, even in our happiest moments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This being said, let me state the obligations of students.
The first</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>obligation, particularly operative during the first weeks of
a new semester,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is a moderately good will toward the teacher, a trust, a
confidence that is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>willing to admit to oneself that the teacher has probably
been through the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>matter, and, unlike the student, knows where it all leads. I
do not want</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>here to neglect the dangers of the ideological professor, of
course, the one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who imposes his mind on what is. But to be a student
requires a certain</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>modicum of humility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet to be a student also requires a certain amount of faith
in oneself, a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>certain self-insight that makes a person realize that he can
learn something</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that seems unlearnable in the beginning. This trust in the
teacher also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>implies that the student, if he has trouble understanding,
makes this known</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the teacher. Teachers just assume that everything they
say or illustrate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is luminously clear. A student does a teacher a favor by
saying, &quot;I do not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understand this&quot;. But the student should first really
try to understand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>before speaking. To quote Augustine again, students should
&quot;consider within</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>themselves whether what has been explained has been said
truly&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The student ought to have the virtue of docility. He owes
the teacher his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>capacity of being taught. We must allow ourselves to be
taught. We can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>actually refuse this openness of our own free wills. This
refusal is mostly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a spiritual thing with roots of the profoundest sort in
metaphysics and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ethics. In the beginning, we only have a &quot;blank
tablet&quot;, as Aristotle said</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of our minds, but it is a brain we have and not just
nothing. We can only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>discover something, even ourselves, by being first given
something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students do not, as St. Augustine said, go to schools to
learn what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>professors happen to think. Rather, they go that they might,
along with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their professors, hear together the &quot;inner truth&quot;
of things, a grace that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>engages all alike in one enterprise that takes them beyond
the confusions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and confines of the classroom to the heart of reality, that
to which our own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>intellects ought to &quot;conform&quot;, as Aquinas said,
when we possess the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[6] When a teacher, crusty as he may be, sees his students
leave his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>classroom for the last time at the end of some fall or spring
semester, he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wants them to carry with them not so much the memories of
his jokes-though</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he hopes they laughed-or his tests, but the internal
possession of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>subject matter itself. The student ought to become
independent of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>teacher to the point of even forgetting his name, but, not
the truth he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>learned. This latter is what education is about-not about
class lists and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rank and the tenure of professors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the student owes to his teacher the effort of study. A
good teacher ought</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to exercise a mild coercion on his students, a kind of
pressure that takes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into account their lethargy and fallenness and distractions,
a pressure that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>indicates that the professor wants the students to learn,
lets them know it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is important, a pressure that has a purpose of guiding the
students through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the actual thought process, the actual exercise of the mind
on the matter at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hand. Few students, on being given The Republic of Plato or
The Confessions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of St. Augustine to read, will bounce right up to their
room, shut off the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>stereo, cancel a date, and proceed to ponder the eternal
verities in these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>books. The teacher who assigns such books-and a university
in which they are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not assigned has little claim to that noble name-always must
wonder if the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>intrinsic fascination, the thinking through of such works
will somehow reach</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into his students' minds. He hopes that the next time they
read Plato or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Augustine, they will do so because they want to, because
they are challenged</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by them, and not because they might receive a C- grade if
they do not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, the student owes the teacher trust, docility, effort,
thinking. And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what is it the teacher can expect of his students? Augustine
said it well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The students actually learn, when they actively think the
thoughts of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mankind, when the &quot;inner truths&quot; of things
themselves actually make</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>themselves known to them, in their own minds. Thus, they
learn as a result</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of their own going through what the teacher hopefully
advises, guides them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through, what the teacher has said. Only then, Augustine said,
in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>marvelous passage we cited in the beginning of these
reflections, do &quot;they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>applaud...&quot; They applaud not so much the teacher who
was once like them a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pupil, the teacher whom they will soon forget, but the
&quot;inner truth&quot; itself,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which, as Aristotle also said, is a part of the &quot;all
things&quot; of reality that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are given, that we actually &quot;become&quot;, that we
are blessed to know even by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ourselves in this vale of tears. Ultimately, teaching is an
act of humility,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as is learning. It is the realization that the highest
things, of which we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>possess but the beginnings, are to be known, can be known by
each of us in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our own selves, and none of us is the less in the learning.</p>
