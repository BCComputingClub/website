<p class=MsoNormal>A brief excerpt from <b><i>Treating Our Students as Adults</i></b>
by Judith L. Gersting and Frank H. Young, Inroads — The SIGCSE Bulletin, Vol.
35, No. 2, June 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the implications of treating students as
adults?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In your conversations do you
refer to your students as &quot;kids&quot; or do you use terms that more
appropriately describe adults?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In your
course syllabus and grading information, do you make absolutely clear what is
expected of the students?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you hold
your students to high standards, including deadlines for assignments?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you clearly covey your standards
regarding honesty and cheating, and impose consequences for violations?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you admit when you do not know the answer
to a question?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you ask students
themselves to find the answer to a question? <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>Do you expect students to come to class prepared, are they aware
of this expectation, and are there consequences if they do not fulfill this
expectation?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How many times have we
heard colleagues explain away inappropriate behavior by calling the perpetrators
&quot;immature students&quot; — uttering that phrase almost as if it were a
single word?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Immature students do not
become mature students if we excuse their behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Of course, we are not advocating that you become a martinet in
your classroom — far from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Part of
treating students as adults is maintaining an openness and a respectful
relationship that will invite them to come to your office, discuss their
problems (both academic and personal), and allow for exceptional circumstances
to be treated in a fair and kindly manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we treat our students as adults then we may very well be
their next-to-last teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is
the very real possibility that they will learn to be their own teachers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That, in the final analysis, is what
adulthood is really about.</p>
