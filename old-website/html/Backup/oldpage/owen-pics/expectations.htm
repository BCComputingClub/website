<h1><font color="#800000">Expectations</font></h1>
<p><img border="0" src="red_gold_bar.gif" width="765" height="18"></p>
<p><font size="5" color="#800000">Expectations we have of college students are
substantially higher than those we have of high school students.&nbsp; You are
young adults in the final stages of your preparations to enter the world and
take up the mantle of responsibility as citizens of a great republic.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" color="#800000">The first expectation we have of you is that
you are striving to assume this role.&nbsp; This means you are working to
develop or have already developed:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -10; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0"><font size="5" color="#800000"><b>Personal
    Discipline</b> — as reflected by a serious attitude towards your studies,
    the effort to acquire the necessary skills to do well, and the discipline to
    manage your time, and perform the work you need to perform in order to excel.
    </font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -10"><font size="5" color="#800000"><b>Responsibility</b>
    — as reflected in taking ownership of your life and this means that you
    shoulder the load.&nbsp; The only one responsible for your success or
    failure is you.&nbsp; The mark of a failure to assume responsibility is that
    of playing the &quot;blame game&quot; — seeking to shift the
    responsibility for your success to others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming personal
    responsibility is a mark of maturity.</font></li>
