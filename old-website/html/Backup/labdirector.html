This is a great lab for both the Computer Science Department and the ACM club. 
The lab holds experimental computer equipment.
<br><br>
For Linux work, the Computer Science runs a lab of 11 Fedora Core 6 Linux
computers.
<br><br>
<p>Currently the lab houses:
<ul>
<li>  2 Windows PCs
<li>  3 Fedora Core 6 PCs
<li>  1 Fedora Core PC for web site development
<li> 11 auxiliary research computers
<li>  1 Netgear Print Server with Printer
<li>  1 Linksys NAS Drive
<li>  1 plotting station (in development)
<li>  6 tables with 4 chairs and surprisingly a lot of space. 
</ul>

<p>The lab has been used for
<ul>
<li> Computer Architecture (3 times)
<li> Operating Systems and Networks (3 times)
<li> Scientific Computing (once)
<li> Geographic Information Systems (once)
<li> 5 senior seminar projects (Anthony Clark, Drew McQueen, Stuart Story, Laura Roberts, Ian Cherry) 
<li> 1 art course (Megan)
</ul>

Lab improvements and updates:</p>

<p>Summer 2007 - Massive lab renovation by Dr. Keefer.  Five new racks
are installed along with the four already in position. More computers and
indirect lighting are added to the lab.  Dr. Keefer uses the lab resources 
to get a computer working for another professor.</p>

<p>Spring 2007 - Megan Ortiz uses the ACM lab to work on her Art Project
to great success. </p>

<p>Fall 2006 - Anthony Clark uses the ACM lab to work on his senior
seminar in Alice and Computer Graphics. </p>

<p>Summer 2006 - Upgrade of webpage by Megan Ortiz and Dr. Keefer. 
Installation of a flatbed cart, a heavy-duty handtruck, and a giant rolling bookcart 
to deliver Matlab and GIS materials to students. 
Memory chip and computer system optimization analysis by Dr. Keefer. 
Vertical shelf analysis (much needed) to determine optimal space management for the ACM lab. </p>

<p>Spring 2006 - Drew McQueen uses ACM Lab facilities for his senior seminar project 
on wireless hacking to successfully hack a WEP-128bit key in 90 seconds.</p>

<p>Summer 2005 - Total redesign of ACM lab and newly waxed floor. 
New router (Linksys), webserver, and mass storage facility (Linksys).  
Dr. Keefer (all), Dr. Schneider (network), Joe Meslovich (programming of new router), 
Henry Elsea and Anthony Clark (moving equipment), Megan Ortiz (web).</p>

<p>March 2005 - Analyzed the memory of every machine and Lauren Bellela produced new system specs.  
Someone took several machines apart. Later, Joshua Randall and Dr. Keefer rebuilt several of the machines.</p>

<p>January 2005 - Updated several computers to get every computer running.</p>

<p>September 2004 - Stuart Story and Dr. Keefer worked to rearrange and
clean out the lab to support the ATM network for Stuart's senior
seminar project.  This was another major redesign of the entire lab. 
They also installed two more rack systems to give more space and 4 carts 
that house spare parts and help keep the lab clean.</p>

<p>May 2004 - Dr. Bender donated his plotter and scanner station to the ACM lab.</p>

<p>April 2004 -  Matt Gibbs, Andrea Bodkin, Stuart Story, and a few other students
helped to assemble the most damaged computers.</p>

<p>February 2004 -  Nate Conrad, Justin Brooks, Chad Holloway, Joel Dove, and Travis
McMullen helped improve the Beowulf and create two GIS workstations as part of their 
Scientific Computing course. 
Laura Roberts used the lab for her ISM senior seminar: Business and GIS.<br></p>

<p>September 2003 - Ian Cherry and Dr. Keefer began major upgrades to hardware to 
support Ian's senior seminar on building a Beowulf cluster to
write supercomputer programs. They eventually were able to use eight
computers in the cluster.Basically every machine in the lab was devoted
to running his programs. They also installed 2 rack systems to help gain
space in the cramped space. Ian and Dr. Keefer opened, cleaned, updated, 
and developed specification sheets for every computer.</p>
 
<p>March 2003 - Ian Lewis and Tim McLaughlin worked on the first batch even more
to support the Operating Systems class.</p>

<p>October 2002 - Ian Lewis helped Dr. Keefer work on the first batch of donated
computers.</p>
