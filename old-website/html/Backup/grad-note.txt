    I have compiled some interesting information about graduate 
    schools you might find helpful in your search.

    This document was designed for students trying to get into grad school,
    but it should also help for students trying to get into undergrad.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to decide to go to graduate school:

    Many perspective graduate students have a hard time deciding when to 
    go to graduate school.  Here are some reasons to go after graduating:

1)  Your health is good.  

2)  You are not married, and therefore willing to move.

3)  You have studied for 4 years and still like the academic lifestyle.

4)  You are up-to-date on the latest technology used in university settings.
    
5)  You wont have to relearn information taught in your classes.  
    This is important, especially in the technical disciplines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding school information:

1)  The best source is Peterson's Guide to Graduate Schools.
    It has phone numbers for contact, email addresses, and program info.
    Located in GMU library reference section at REF L 901 P444 1996.

2)  Colliers Encyclopedia in the library reference section under "Colleges".
    Contains school size, affiliation (state, church, private), and location.

3)  College Catalogs.  GMU does not have many of these.  
    Located near the reference section CD-ROM databases.

4)  Write the school and request catalogs.  Get entire picture of the school.
    Location and size is usually important.  Don't just go by the school 
    reputation or department reputation.

5)  Your academic department might have a small library of school catalogs.

6)  Your academic department usually has flyers for other schools programs.
    These are good.  They usually contain field concentration information,
    professor credentials, and a postcard to send for an application.

7)  Professors might have some information or at least have preferences.
    Professors may have connections at other schools.

8)  If your program is associated with a professional organization, the 
    organization will probably have a publication with graduate school info.
    For example, Comp Sci has the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery).
    These are usually good and kept up-to-date.  They include the GRE scores 
    needed to enter, size of program, professors interests, & assistantships.
    The organization also may have a web site that is even more up-to-date.
    This organization may also have scholarships available.

9)  Most schools have very good World Wide Web pages.  Use Netscape in the
    labs or library if you can.  They also will contain an email form where
    you can click on a link and send a message requesting an application.
    Some of these also ask for GRE and GPA (optional) and Email address.  
    Some schools will send the information by email.  Have some disk space 
    available.  One school sent me 150 blocks of info by email.  Ouch!

10) This web site has schools by state with links to almost every school.
    I think the address is still: 
           http://isl-garnet.uah.edu/Universities/universities.htm

11) U.S. News and World Report Guide to Best Graduate Schools.

12) GREs are tests almost all grad schools require for entrance.  GRE subject
    tests are usually required or recommended, but not always.  The two tests
    can be taken in the same day.  Each one is 3 hours long.  
    Application forms can be picked up at the Counseling & Testing Center
    on the first floor of Ramstad.  Make sure to get a practice book also.
    Practice books by various companies can be bought in the book store.
    Tests are given in Ramstad and Xavier.

    GREs consist of a Quantitative (Math) section, a Verbal (English) section,
    and a Analytical section (Reasoning) section.  They are offered three 
    times a year.  Computer-based general tests are offered.

    GRE subject tests are offered (3 times a year) for many different areas.

    With each test, scores can be sent to up to 4 different schools free of 
    charge.  After that, it costs $13 to send the scores to each school.

    This years schedule:   Tests were given in mid October and December.
                           Applications are due on Mar 8 for the April test.

    When should the tests be taken?  Some schools want applications by the
    first of January.  It would be nice to visit schools at the end of your 
    junior year and have the test scores in hand.  Scholarship applications 
    for professional organizations and government agencies are due near Nov 1
    and sometimes require GRE scores.  

    I recommend taking the general test in Dec of your Junior year and the
    subject test the following April.  This gives you time to take a test 
    again.  You will also have the scores for scholarship forms.

    When you fill out the form for the GREs, select the student locator
    service.  Its free and the list of students gets sent to the schools
    which match the locator criteria.  See the GRE application.

Before Applying:

1)  Attempt to get an internship/summer job related to your field.

2)  Look at professors' research areas and make contact.  Ask for a copy of
    a paper they worked on or email them about their research.  

3)  Try to visit schools and meet with a professor in the department.
    Read the catalog before attending.  Also, have a list of questions to 
    ask and be able to tell why you want to attend the school.

4)  Watch for recruiting visits from college representatives.
    Some grad departments have open houses for perspective students.
    Look at web sites or call departments at desired schools for info.

5)  Work on resume and statement of purpose (goals for graduate study).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applying:

1)  Schools have different deadlines for applications.  Some are due Jan 1.
    Others are due Feb 1, March 1, April 1, and May 1.  Make sure
    application materials get to you a month before you need to send them out.
    It may take a while to develop a good resume & statement of purpose.
    Other information may need to be found before the forms can be filled out.
    This also gives professors time to fill out the recommendations.

2)  Apply to schools whose requirements are slightly above and below your
    academic range (gre & gpa).  Look at Peterson's Guide for acceptance
    rates.  Apply to some schools you think will accept you. 

3)  Contact professors for recommendations.

4)  Some professors want pre-stamped and addressed envelopes to send your 
    recommendations.  Others will have the department address the envelopes.

5)  Many schools now require 2 academic transcripts sent (Registrar Office).
    They also want financial aid transcripts (Financial Aid Office).

6)  In the semester in which you apply, take fewer classes.  Some of the
    forms are very extensive and require essays and statements of purpose.

7)  Photocopy all forms before you fill them out.  If a mistake is made,
    you can fill out the photocopy.

8)  Most applications require: GPA, Statement of purpose or letter of intent,
                               Resume, Areas of interest, 3 Recommendations,
                               Previous work experience with references,
                               Financial aid information.

9)  A book that can be order from the bookstore to help with personal 
    statements is, "How to Write a Winning Personal Statement for Graduate
    and Professional School" by Richard Stelzer.  Get the Second edition.
    Cost: $10-$12.  Allow 1-4 weeks to receive it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Applying:

1)  School recruiters will sometimes call for interviews.  Be ready.  Put 
    copies of all of your application materials into an envelope for each 
    school.  Have a list of questions to ask each one next to the phone.
    Study up on terms in your discipline so that if you are asked about your
    interest in a particular area you are up-to-date on the subject matter.
    Read the new material in your area.  The library has lots of magazines.

2)  Make sure GRE scores and grade transcripts are received.  Many colleges
    send out postcards confirming receipt.  Late information might make your
    application late.

3)  If you get accepted to more than one school, visits are a good idea.
    The school may fly you to look at their program.    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember:  The best school is the one where you enjoy what you are doing.
           You will be living & studying there for several years.  
           The schools reputation does not help if you do not like it there.  

I hope this helps.  If anyone has other sources that would be helpful to 
distribute, or would like to be removed from this mailing list, email me.
